# Term Planner User Stories

### As a teacher who needs to have a high level overview of the strands and substrands I will be teaching each term, when I open my term planner, I want:

- To be presented with a table that has one row for each term
- Have a colour-coded column for each subject

### When I click on a cell in the table, I want:

- To be presented with a list of the strands and substrands for that subject
- To be able to add a strand or substrand to the list
- To be able to remove a strand or substrand from the list
- To have that strand or substrand placed into a "already selected" list

# Assessments User Stories

### As a teacher who is required to conduct assessments, I want to be able to:

- Add an assessment to my list of assessments
- Remove an assessment from my list of assessments
- Edit an assessment on my list of assessments
- Choose which subject each assessment is for
- Choose which topic each assessment is for
- Choose which year level each assessment is for
- View the results of my assessments for each student
- See whether the assessment has already been scheduled
- Schedule an assessment
- Edit the scheduled date of an assessment
- Delete the scheduled date of an assessment
- See whether the assessment has already been conducted
- Record the results of an assessment against each student
- Differentiate between formative and summative assessments
- For formative assessments, notes about these should be recorded against each student in the lesson planner
- For summative assessments, these should have a grade from A-E or a percentage and the ability to add a comment against each
- For summative assessments, these should be aggregated into a single grade for each subject

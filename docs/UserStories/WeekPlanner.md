# Week Planner User Stories

### As a teacher who is required to plan lessons, I want to be able to:

- Open my diary and be presented with a list of my classes for the week based on the timetable template made in the settings page
- See the time and day of each class
- Have the ability to add a class to my diary
- Have the ability to remove a class from my diary
- Have the ability to edit a class in my diary
- Have the ability to make my lesson go for longer than one period
- Have a button in the bottom of each lesson that allows me to add a comment for that lesson
- Have in each lesson the title, bullet points that I have written about what we will be doing, a header for and list of links to resources (if any), and a header and list of links to assessments (if any)

* Have a weekly overview showing a todo list of all comments I have made about the lessons for that week

### When I open my weekly overview, I want to be able to:

- Have the ability to add a comment to the todo list
- Have the ability to strike out a comment in the todo list if I do not want to follow up on it
- Have the ability to add a tick next to completed comments in the todo list

# Reports User Stories

### As a teacher who is required to write reports for my students, I want to be able to:

- Generate report comments for each subject
- Aggregate grades from assessments
- View a list of all my students
- View an individual student
- Make notes for each student
- There should be a space to enter comments for English, Maths and General comments
- The comment space should have a character limit that matches the character limit on Accelerus
- The character limit can be set in the settings page
- For each student, comments made in the lesson planner should be displayed under headers for the appropriate subject
- Comments from the previous semester should be visible but in a different colour
